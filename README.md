# Postbot
Postbot is a new AI tool developed by Postman that uses machine learning algorithms to suggest likely endpoint and parameter values when testing APIs. By leveraging Postbot's AI capabilities, software QA engineers can create more accurate, reliable, and efficient API tests.

# Features
Postbot includes the following features:

- Fast test creation: Postbot's AI capabilities can help software QA engineers quickly create API tests by suggesting likely endpoint and parameter values.
- Improved accuracy: Postbot's machine learning algorithms can make more accurate predictions about likely endpoint and parameter values than a human could make on their own.
- Error reduction: By suggesting likely endpoint and parameter values, Postbot can reduce errors that can occur when manually entering values.
- Better test coverage: Postbot can help software QA engineers ensure that they are testing all the necessary endpoints and parameters by suggesting likely values.
- Increased efficiency: By reducing the time and effort required to create and run API tests, Postbot can help software QA engineers be more efficient.
# Usage
To use Postbot, you must have a Postman account with the AI/ML features enabled. Once you have logged into your account, you can access Postbot by clicking the AI Assistant button in the bottom right corner of the Postman app.
